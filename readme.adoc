# Refactor monolith to microservices

This workspace will show how to refactor a Java EE monolith to a
microservices-based application. This will be accomplished in multiple
phases:

. Phase 1: Functional decomposition of a `WAR` into multiple `WAR`s. Use hardcoded service URIs.
. Phase 2: Use service registration and discovery
. Phase 3: Continuous integration
. Phase 4: Continuous deployment
. Phase 5: Proactive monitoring and scale in/out
. Phase 6: Change the implementation stack of a service

## Run the application

. Start ZooKeeper

  docker run -d -p 2181:2181 fabric8/zookeeper

. Download and unzip http://download.jboss.org/wildfly/9.0.0.Final/wildfly-9.0.0.Final.zip[WildFly 9.0.0.Final]
. Run WildFly

  ./bin/standalone.sh

. Deploy the application

  mvn -f microservice/pom.xml install -DskipTests

## NoOps

Operational concerns are addressed in the following documents:
